# MARIOPARTY Hard
The purpose of this guide is to document the items i've found while exploring Hydlide using the **MARIOPARTY** Seed on Hard Difficulty.

Most of the choices made in this guide were informed by:
- Retroachievement's guide by Cykkette: https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki/Virtual-Hydlide
- Mechalink's Speedrun Guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oGy78nvTUnASmYIBs0UDbFk8AOQW6YOnm12f0UBxeGQ

This is a work in progress, if you find anything that's not documented please open an issue

# Changes in Hard Difficulty
As per Mechalink's [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oGy78nvTUnASmYIBs0UDbFk8AOQW6YOnm12f0UBxeGQ) :
- You start with nothing
- The map turns into a self-mapping feature, where it will appear on the map once you enter the chunk
- The blue compass no longer directs you until you have exposed the destination on the map
- The shop is no longer available.
    - Due to this, the starting location is different from Easy and Normal.
- Leveling only restores as much health as you gain.
- Enemy defense is increased enough to make some enemies that could be stunned become near-unstunnable.
    - Wizard/Evil Mage does not get stunned, so prepare to block multiple volleys. You can sneak in a hit between volleys if youâ€™re fast.
- Water healing spots in the Mines appear gone (Lvl 4 and Lvl 5 on verified)
